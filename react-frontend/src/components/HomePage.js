        <p>Once upon a time, a group of engineers at MPR got bored of eating lunch at their desks alone, 
          so they decided to go for lunch together every Friday. However, there are too many restaurant 
          options in Old Town and they don't want to fight over it every week, so they decided to vote for
           where to go for lunch every week because they like democracy more than fighting.</p>
